                <h3> Hello, I'm Lazy Dog. </h3>
                <h5> I am a designer, photographer, and filmmaker from Providence, Rhode Island.  </h5>
                <p2> My goal is to design interfaces that offer a transparent and unbiased experience.  As a photographer,
                    I am especially interested in how our media outlets shape the way we create, consume, and distrubute videos and photos.
                    I think media platfroms should function as blank canvases that allow (and don't flatten) the various ways we express ourselves.  
                    As I am still a student of design, the work I have here showcases my development as a designer striving to create interfaces
                    which don't get in the way.  In my future projects, I hope to focus on specifically photographic websites and applications.

                    Project Gutenberg is one of the largest online e-Book libraries on the web.
                    Because of my interest in media distribution platforms, I decided to redeign their old website to enhance ease of use and aesthetic value.
                    Throughout the project, I made sure to stick closely with Project Gutenberg's commitment to adaptability and freedom of use.</p1>

                    In May 2022, I hiked the Camino De Sangtiago in Spain.  I brought along my grandfathers
                film camera and took a series of photographs.  Since they are film, and not digital, I have since struggled to 
            interact with and share the photos. In order to practice my react skills, and also experiment
        with the presentation and filtering of my photographic work, I decided to create a website of my Camino photographs to share with friends.  </p1>

                    Every morning, my roomates and I use the same toaster.  In order to practice my storyboarding and persona creation
                skills, I decided to use the device as a test subject.  By analyzing my roomate's interactions with the device I was able to
            achieve a more nuanced perspective on how small design choices can change how our mornings unfold.  Please check out an overview of
        the process below to see how I used storyboards and personas to dig deeper into a simple interface. </p1>

                    Beyond digital design, I am also interested in how physical objects can pull us away from our
                phones and into the real world.  In my Material Design class, I designed a small light box that operates off of
            the users' phone flashlights.  This experiemental design project is my modern take on the campfire - instead of tinder
        and sticks the user must place their phone in the box to light up the room.   </p1>
